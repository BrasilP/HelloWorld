# Strings

ex_1 = 'This is a string.'
ex_2 = "This is a string."

# Important !
# There is no significant difference when using enclosed single quotes ('') or double quotes (""). However, most
# programmers prefer the double quotes as they can use single quotes within strings without having to use escape
# sequences.
